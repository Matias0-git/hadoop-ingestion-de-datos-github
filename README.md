# hadoop-ingestion-de-datos-github
This repository contains a simple bash script (landing.sh) designed to automate a data engineering task: ingesting data from a web source into HDFS. The script downloads a .csv file from a GitHub repository to a local "landing" directory and then securely transfers it to a designated HDFS directory.
